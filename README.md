## Coursera - Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the project for the course "Getting and Cleaning Data" of the Data Science specialization at Coursera. The repo includes four files:

# 1 tidy_data.txt

-- The tidy dataset of the project

# 2 run_analysis.R

-- The R script that merged, combined and cleaned the raw data. Specifically:
   1) Merges the training and the test data into one dataset.
   2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
   3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
   4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
   5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# 3 codebook.md

-- The code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.
